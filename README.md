AtomExpress is a simple set of domain models that support:

* Atom feeds []
* RSS feeds []
* Activity Streams []

Additionally, there is a corresponding set of 'builders' with their own fluent DSLs that enable simple creation of same:

* AtomFeedBuilder
* RssFeedBuilder
* ActivityStreamBuilder

BTW, RestExpress () will marshal these domain models to JSON or XML by default...
